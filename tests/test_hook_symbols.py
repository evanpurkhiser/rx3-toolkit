"""The hook must not need a symbol rbp cannot supply.

Both hook builds are `-nostdlib` shared objects that resolve their imports
against whatever rbp already has loaded. An import rbp does not export is not a
link error and not a warning: the library simply fails to load at run time, the
mod goes silent, and what is drawn is stock output that looks like a
different bug entirely. That failure has cost this project two long debugging
rounds -- once on a missing definition in the shim, once on `bcmp`.

`bcmp` is the specific trap. At -O2 clang rewrites `memcmp(a, b, n) == 0` into a
call to `bcmp`, which this glibc does not export. The rewrite happens in the
optimiser, after every diagnostic the front end could have produced, so nothing
says a word. `-fno-builtin-memcmp` in the Makefile suppresses it; this test is
what keeps that flag from being dropped by someone tidying up.
