## What you get

### 🎤 Stems in standalone mode

Prepare stems of your tracks on your computer, load them on the RX3 the usual way, and the **Slip Loop** PADs mode or **STEM** on screen tab turns into stem control:

| Pad | Colour | What it does |
| :--: | :--: | --- |
| **7** | 🔴 Red | Instrumental on / off |
| **8** | 🟢 Green | Vocal on / off |

### 🎹 Key shift

Tune the key of your songs to mix harmonically (or play for Alvin & the Chipmunks). A **KEY** tab shows up on the screen:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **KEY −** / **KEY +** | One semitone down or up, twelve either way |
| **The number in the middle** | Tap it and the deck goes back to `0` |

Pioneer actually shipped a pitch shifter for the Beat FX "PITCH". While it sounds gorgeous going down, the audio quality is like a broken fax going up. Our brand new AI-generated pitch shifter algorithm is exactly the opposite kind of bad. So the mod uses whichever one wins the direction you asked for.

### ⏭️ 32-beat Beat Jump

Beat Jump gets a new **32-beat** mode. Repeated presses also fire straight away instead of waiting for the grid to catch up.

### 🔌 Lives on the USB stick, not in the player

Everything runs from the stick and disappears when the power goes off. Any RX3 you plug your stick on will be modded. Nothing is written to the player's internal memory, so there is no firmware to back up and nothing to uninstall.

**Power off → pull the stick → power on → stock RX3.**

---

## What you need

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🎛️ **Player** | Pioneer DJ XDJ-RX3, firmware `1.19` only at the moment |
| 💻 **Computer** | macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon), Windows x64, or Linux x64 |
| 💾 **USB stick** | A normal Rekordbox export, FAT32 or exFAT |
| 🧱 **A root filesystem** | Built on your machine from the manufacturer's published GPL sources — [see below](#4-getting-a-root-filesystem) |
| 📀 **Disk space** | ~1.5 GB, only if you want stems |

About **20 minutes** to set everything up. After that, stems take from a few seconds to a few minutes per track. A GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, or Apple Silicon) makes that dramatically faster.

---

## Before you start

**Read this bit.** It is short.

- **Nothing is flashed.** The toolkit does not write to the player's internal storage. It uses the maintenance mechanism Pioneer built into the RX3 to run software from a USB stick, and everything lives in memory until you power off.
- **There is a safety net.** If the modified player does not survive the first few seconds, the original one is put back automatically.
- **It can still crash.** Modified software on a live machine is modified software on a live machine. That matters rather a lot when the thing is plugged into a 20 kW PA. **Test at home. Test the actual stick, the actual tracks, several times. Keep a clean Rekordbox stick in the bag.**
- **Warranty.** Running unofficial software on consumer hardware may affect what the manufacturer is willing to do for you. Nothing here is permanent, but that is not a promise about anyone's warranty decisions.
- **Liability.** This is an educational and experimental project. If it crashes during your $50,000 set, that would be unfortunate. I do wish you the $50,000 set.
- **Music.** Separation happens on your computer, on your files. What you are allowed to copy, process and perform depends on your licences and your jurisdiction, not on this tool.
- **Affiliation.** Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Pioneer DJ or AlphaTheta. Product names identify compatible gear and nothing more.

---

## Quick start

Do these in order. For your first go, I'd suggest you use a spare USB stick and two or three tracks.

### 1. Check your firmware

Remove every USB stick, power the RX3 on, hold **MENU (UTILITY)** for a second, scroll to the bottom.

```text
VERSION No. 1.19
```

Anything else and you should stop here — the toolkit is built against this exact version and simply will not apply itself to another one. AlphaTheta documents updating [in its support article](https://support.alphatheta.com/en-US/articles/5097637194137?product=4416587179673).

Power the RX3 back off.

### 2. Download the app

Grab the build for your computer from the [**Releases page**](../../releases) and unpack it wherever you keep applications.

<details>
<summary><b>macOS says the app is damaged / Windows shows a warning</b></summary>

The app is not code-signed yet, which means your computer suspects it could be malicious.

**macOS** — clear the quarantine flag your browser put on the download. Open the Terminal application (in the Utilities folder), type `xattr -rc` followed by a space, then drag the app into the window to fill in the path:

```sh
xattr -rc "/Applications/XDJ-RX3 Toolkit.app"
```

`No such file or directory` means the path is wrong: it must point at the unpacked `.app` itself, not the `.zip` and not the folder around it.

**Windows** — SmartScreen will complain. Choose **More info → Run anyway**.

**Linux** — unpack and run; you may need to mark the file executable first.

</details>

### 3. Prepare your stems *(optional)*

Skip this if you only want the longer beat jumps.

1. In Rekordbox, make a playlist with the tracks you want stems for. Two or three, for a first run.
2. Export your Rekordbox collection **as XML** (Preferences → *Advanced* or *View*, depending on your version). This is not the same as exporting to a stick. The app reads it to find where your audio files are.
3. Open the app, go to the **Stems preparation** tab, and hit **Set up… → Install**. Separation needs a lot of software that is too big to ship in the download, so it gets installed once into its own private folder. You need an internet connection, ~1.5 GB free, and Python 3.10–3.13 ([python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you have none — take 3.13). If it stops halfway, press **Install** again; it picks up where it left off.
4. Select your XML, your playlist, and your Rekordbox USB stick.
5. Pick a quality:

   | Preset | Use it when |
   | --- | --- |
   | **High quality** | The stems are going in a set |
   | **Normal** | Most of the time |
   | **Very fast** | Auditioning a playlist, or a long queue has to finish tonight |

The top two are the same model at two settings, so switching between them downloads nothing and costs you no quality — only time. Only **Very fast** swaps the model itself. What the app can actually reach depends on your graphics card, and the line under the selector tells you what *your* machine resolves to rather than what is true in general.

6. Start it. The app estimates how long the run will take, then corrects itself after the first track and remembers your machine's speed for next time. If it works out at more than ten minutes it asks first, because it will occupy the machine — keep the computer plugged in and awake.

Each track produces a `.rx3stem` file in an `RX3_STEMS` folder inside the output folder you chose. If that was not your Rekordbox USB stick, move `RX3_STEMS` to the root of the stick now.

```text
Your USB stick
├── Contents    ← this holds your exported Rekordbox audio files
├── PIONEER
└── RX3_STEMS   ← the new one
```

> [!NOTE]
> The stem playlist itself does **not** need to go on the stick, but it totally can. The player matches stems automatically — by filename, so a stem sits next to the track it came from and neither has to be renamed.

Keep the laptop plugged in and awake. If one track fails the queue carries on — read the log at the end. If *every* track fails, the install is incomplete: run **Install** again. See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#every-track-fails).

An interrupted run picks up where it stopped: stems already made are kept.

<details>
<summary><b>Where does all that software actually go?</b></summary>

Not into the app, and not into your system. It lives in one folder you can delete:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/RX3 Stem Studio` |
| **Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RX3 Stem Studio` |
| **Linux** | `~/.local/share/rx3-stem-studio` |

The folder keeps the name an earlier, separate stems application used, so that if you had it, its runtime is found instead of downloaded all over again. `RX3_STEM_STUDIO_HOME` moves it somewhere else.

**Advanced options…** is where you uninstall it, pick a different graphics accelerator, or browse the model list. Changing accelerator means installing again — a processor-only build cannot be accelerated afterwards.

If you already have `audio-separator` and `ffmpeg` on your machine, they get used as they are and nothing is installed. `RX3_SEPARATOR` and `RX3_FFMPEG` point at specific ones.

</details>

### 4. Getting a root filesystem

The player only loads the file we are about to build if it is encrypted the way its own maintenance path expects, so the app needs that material to author it. You get it yourself, on your own machine, from sources the manufacturer publishes.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Nothing of the sort is distributed here.** This step is yours to run, and what it leaves on your disk stays on your disk.

The XDJ-RX3 runs Linux, so under the GPL/LGPL Pioneer publishes the corresponding source archives on its [open source distribution page](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/support/open-source-code-distribution/gnu-open-source-license/). Getting a root filesystem out of those archives is described in [**Getting a root filesystem**](docs/extract-initramfs.md). It is archive handling, the same on all three systems. A Linux environment is needed only to rebuild that filesystem, not to read it. What comes out stays on your disk; point the app at it in the next step.

### 5. Build the file for your stick

Now that the hard part is done, in the **Modules installation** tab: pick firmware `1.19`, choose the modules you want, pick what step 4 produced, pick the **root of your Rekordbox stick** as the destination, then **Mod your RX3!**.

Here is what you are choosing from:

| Module | What it does | On by default |
| --- | --- | :--: |
| **Stems control** | Slip Loop pads 7 and 8 become independent vocal and instrumental switches, on tracks that have a stem file | ✅ |
| **Per-deck key shift** | A **KEY** tab on screen, twelve semitones either way, independently per deck | ✅ |
| **Beat Jump ±32** | Beat Jump pads 7 and 8 become −32 and +32 instead of −8 and +8 | ✅ |
| **Immediate Beat Jump** | Repeated jumps fire straight away instead of waiting for the grid. Quantize, Hot Cues, loops and Beat FX are untouched | ✅ |
| **No more wait between beatjumps** | Makes the player access audio files faster when beatjumping, so big jumps can be repeated sooner. Nothing to see, it just helps the two above | ✅ |
| **Session logging** | Writes what happened to `RX3_RUNTIME/session.txt` on the stick. Tick it when something went wrong and you want to know why | ❌ |
| **Diagnostic Telnet access** | Opens a shell for inspection. You do not need this | ❌ |
| **USB Wi-Fi** | Uses a supported RTL8188CU adapter as the player's stock Link Export network interface | ❌ |

Some boxes tick and untick themselves, and that is on purpose: a few modules genuinely need another one to work.

> [!WARNING]
> **Session logging** is off by default for a reason that will cost you a stick if you ignore it. While it is on, the player holds that log file open for as long as it plays. **Eject the drive from the RX3 — never just pull it out.** On a FAT stick, yanking it mid-write is how you lose a folder.

> [!WARNING]
> **Diagnostic Telnet** is off by default and should stay that way unless you know why you want it. The traffic is unencrypted, and it is reachable through the rear computer USB port. The root password won't be provided here.

Eject the stick properly. It should now look like:

```text
USB stick/
├── autoexec.bin      ← the mod, this is the whole thing
├── RX3_STEMS/
├── Contents/
└── PIONEER/
```

### 6. Put it on the player

**Order matters.**

1. Power the RX3 on with the stick **out**.
2. Wait until the interface is fully loaded and responsive.
3. *Now* insert the stick.

The screen freezes, goes away for a few seconds and comes back. While that happens, do not pull the stick, do not cut power, and do not mash the controls because patience has apparently become obsolete.

<details>
<summary><b>Did it work?</b></summary>

The honest answer is: load a track and try the pads. There is no log by default, on purpose — see **Session logging** in the module list above.

**Interface did not come back?** Pull the stick and power cycle — unplug the mains lead if you have to. The RX3 boots stock.

**Something is off and you want to know why?** Build the stick again with **Session logging** ticked and reproduce it. That writes `RX3_RUNTIME/session.txt`, whose last line should read:

```text
=== complete ===
```

The other lines worth recognising:

| Line | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `=== complete ===` | The run finished. This is what a good run ends on. |
| `OK: rbp active` | The player was restarted and came back. |
| `nothing to apply: ...` | Everything you picked was already running. Not an error. |
| `STOP: ...` | Something was not as expected, so **nothing was touched**. |
| `FAILED: ...` | Something went wrong partway, and the previous state was put back. |

On `STOP:` or `FAILED:`, delete `autoexec.bin` from the stick, then see [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#the-session-log-says-stop-or-failed).

</details>

Putting the stick back in later costs nothing: anything already running is recognised and left alone, so the interface does not freeze a second time.

---

## Playing with it

Load one of your prepared tracks and open **Slip Loop**.

Pads 7 and 8 blink while the stem loads, then settle on red and green. They are two independent switches — press pad 8 and the vocal drops out of the mix.

Open **Beat Jump** on the same track: pads 7 and 8 now read `32`.

Open the **KEY** tab on the screen and press `KEY +` a few times: the deck climbs a semitone at a time, up to twelve. The other deck does not follow — each one has its own key. Tap the number in the middle to come straight back to `0`.

Load a track with no stem and Slip Loop behaves exactly like stock. That is the intended fallback, not a failure — if a track you *did* prepare has no stem controls, then either you did something wrong, or I did. See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#a-prepared-track-has-no-stem-controls) first, and open an issue only after that.

---

## Back to stock

1. Stop playback.
2. Power off.
3. Pull the stick.
4. Power on.

Done. Nothing to uninstall, nothing to restore, nothing to reflash.

Leaving the stick in re-applies the mod at the next power-on. To turn it back into an ordinary Rekordbox stick for good, delete `autoexec.bin` from it — your music and your stems can stay.

---

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How does it work?</b></summary><br>

The RX3 runs Linux. By Pioneer's own design, it looks at every USB stick you insert for a file named `autoexec.bin`. If that file decrypts with a key held inside the player, the player runs the script in it. That is the manufacturer's maintenance mechanism, not a way in that anyone found. It runs the script as **root**, the account that is allowed to do anything, which is why a stick can change what the player does.

The whole interface is one program, `rbp` (Rekordbox Portable?). At every start-up the player copies it into memory and runs it from there. Our script edits that copy, in memory. The new features are code running inside the player, using its own fonts, images and pads. Nothing touches permanent storage. Cut the power and the memory forgets all of it; the next start-up copies the stock `rbp` again.

"Patching" means two things. A few precise bytes are rewritten in place — a beat jump of 32 instead of 8 is nothing more than that. Anything bigger arrives as a *shared library*, loaded beside `rbp` and hooked into it from the inside. That is where vocals, instrumentals and the key shifter come from, in a player that shipped with none of the three.

The `KEY` and `STEMS` tabs are the same trick applied to the screen. Touch works because two native Beat FX zones were politely repurposed and handed back on the way out. The pads and the on-screen toggles blink in step because they both count from the same clock.

If anything goes wrong in the seconds after the patch, the original bytes go back, the stock player starts again, and a log on your stick says what happened.

Details for the curious: [how a mod runs without flashing anything](REFERENCES.md#2-how-a-mod-runs-without-flashing-anything).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this flash custom firmware?</b></summary><br>

No. Everything runs in memory and is gone the moment you power off without the stick.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can it brick my RX3?</b></summary><br>

The project does not write to the player's permanent storage, which removes the usual reason custom firmware bricks things. That is not a mathematical proof that nothing can ever go wrong. Unofficial software, own risk.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can it crash?</b></summary><br>

Yes. Test it at home before you rely on it. Using a show as your first test would be an admirably efficient way of turning software testing into performance art.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does every track need stems?</b></summary><br>

No. Prepared and unprepared tracks live happily on the same stick.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Are my original files modified?</b></summary><br>

No. The stem is a separate sidecar file sitting next to the track.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why only firmware 1.19?</b></summary><br>

The mod patches the player software at very specific places, and a firmware update moves that code around. So the toolkit checks it is looking at the player it expects, and refuses if it is not. Support for other versions has to be added and tested deliberately.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why are stems made on the computer and not on the player?</b></summary><br>

Because separation models are big and expensive to run. Doing the heavy work on your laptop means better models, GPU acceleration, no waiting on the RX3, and untouched originals. Improving the model later does not mean rewriting anything on the player. The computer does the absurdly expensive maths; the DJ player gets to carry on being a DJ player.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I update my firmware while this is installed?</b></summary><br>

There is nothing installed. Pull the stick and the unit is stock. But after a firmware change, do not assume the toolkit still works — only use versions listed as supported. **If you do update, do one clean boot cycle without the mod stick first, just in case**.
</details>

## Roadmap

What is being worked on next. No dates, no promises but this is the direction.

| | What it would give you | Status |
| --- | --- | :--: |
| **FX equalization** | The FX equalization of a DJM-900NXS2 to make your echoes and delays not go bang bang | 💡 Planned |
| **Key sync between decks** | The player reads both keys and nudges a deck for you, so you can stop doing musical theory at 2am | 💡 Planned |
| **Proper STEMS / KEY on the display** | The stem and key-shift on the screen are properly integrated and perfectly working | 🚧 In progress |
| **Polished interface** | Icons and lettering on every button the mod adds, close enough to the player's own that you stop noticing which is which | 🚧 In progress |
| **CPU and memory monitoring** | Headroom monitoring so heavier features stay safe to use for a whole set | 💡 Planned |

Want one of these sooner? Or something else? Say so in an issue, or build it yourself (see [Contributing](#contributing)).

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome: new modules, support for future firmware, reverse-engineering notes, UI work, faster separation, testing on other systems, or just better docs. Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

A new module starts with one command, `make new-module ID=your-module`, which writes the files it is made of. `make hook test preflight` then runs everything CI will.

**Reporting a bug?** Enable the logging module on the mod, reproduce the bug, include your firmware version, your OS, the toolkit version, `RX3_RUNTIME/session.txt` log, and the steps to reproduce. For stem problems, add the model, the quality preset, your CPU/GPU, and whether it affects one track or all of them.

Please do **not** attach encryption keys, manufacturer firmware or binaries, or copyrighted material.
