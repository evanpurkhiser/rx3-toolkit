 * Key shift for the RX3 performance runtime: implementation.

 * Included by the core hook after its logging, hook installer and deck table
 * are in place. Nothing in the core implements key shift; it only calls
 * rx3_keyshift_install, rx3_keyshift_remove, and the accessors the KEY panel
 * needs.
 *
 * The pitch stage sits on dsp::TimeStretchScratch::operate and its Master Tempo
 * counterpart, which are the deck's playback blocks. It deliberately does not
 * sit on PcmReader::getStreamAt: that is a random-access read shared with the
 * BPM and waveform analysis scan, and measurement on hardware found only 13.6%
 * of its calls continuing the previous one.
