 * Time-domain pitch shifter for the RX3 performance hook.
 *
 * The firmware's own granular shifter is clean downwards and poor upwards:
 * measured on a 440 Hz tone, -7 semitones leaves 99.9% of the energy on the
 * note while +7 leaves 15.8%, the rest being grain-splice noise. Its grain
 * lengths and crossfade are compiled-in constants, so it cannot be improved
 * from outside. This is the replacement.
 *
 * Two read heads walk a history ring at the pitch ratio, half a grain apart,
 * each windowed by a Hann envelope. Hann at 50% overlap sums to exactly one, so
 * the amplitude is constant and every splice happens where that head's gain is
 * zero. Reads are cubic-interpolated. That is the whole of it: the quality comes
 * from the window satisfying the overlap-add constraint, which is precisely
 * what the stock effect does not do.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose: no libc, no libm, no allocation. The caller owns
 * the history buffer, so the same code runs inside the LD_PRELOAD hook and in
 * the host measurement harness that produced the figures above.

/* Grain length in frames, and it has to depend on the direction.

 * Raising pitch means repeating material: 0.414 s of source per second of
 * output at +6 semitones. The grain decides how that repetition is spread, and
 * a long grain replays whole transients. Measured at +7 semitones against an
 * impulse train of eight hits: 2048 frames returns sixteen -- every hit doubled
 * -- 1024 returns fourteen, 512 returns nine. Below that the shifter falls
 * apart, 256 leaving 0.7% of the energy on the note.
 *
 * Lowering pitch skips material instead of repeating it, so there is no
 * doubling to avoid, and the short grain only costs purity: at -7 semitones,
 * 0.5% of the energy lands on the note with 512 frames against 69% with 2048.

 * Hence one value per direction. */
