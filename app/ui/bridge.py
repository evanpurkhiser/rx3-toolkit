"""What the interface may call, and the only place it may call it from.

One object, one method per operation, plain values in and out. A window binds
this and knows nothing else about the toolkit; a test binds it and needs no
window. Every method returns something JSON can carry, because the interface is
on the other side of a bridge that only carries that.

Failures come back as `{"error": "..."}` rather than as exceptions. An exception
crossing this bridge reaches the interface as a stack trace with no sentence in
it, and the operator reads the sentence.

Arguments arrive positionally. The window packs what JavaScript passed into a
list and calls the method with it, so a method taking `**kwargs` can never be
reached with any of them set. Anything richer than a scalar is therefore one
dict parameter, which the bridge reduces to the keys it knows before a service
sees it.
