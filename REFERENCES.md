# Engineering reference

How this toolkit works, and what we learned about the player while building it.

It assumes you (or your AI) know C, shell and Linux, and nothing about DJ equipment. You do not need any of this to *use* the applications; please start from the [README](README.md) for that.

---

## 1. The machine

The player is an embedded ARM appliance. Nothing exotic, just a bit old.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **SoC** | Freescale/NXP i.MX 6Quad |
| **CPU** | ARMv7-A, 32-bit little-endian, with NEON |
| **ABI** | ARM EABI5, soft-float with FPU registers (`softfp`) |
| **Bootloader** | U-Boot 2009.08 |
| **Kernel** | Linux 3.0.101 |
| **Userland** | BusyBox, glibc 2.13, SysV init |
| **Graphics** | DirectFB drawing straight to a framebuffer device |
| **Application** | a single large C++ binary, dynamically linked and not stripped |

Everything you see on the screen (browser, waveforms, effects, settings) is that one process. It is not stripped, which is the single fact that makes any of this work: symbol names survive, so the binary can be read rather than guessed at.

### Storage layout

Internal flash is partitioned into fixed regions:

| Partition | Size | Holds |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| boot | 3 MiB | the bootloader |
| env | 1 MiB | bootloader environment |
| kernel A / B | 10 MiB each | two kernel slots |
| rootfs | 30 MiB | compressed read-only system image |
| settings | 10 MiB | writable settings |
| pdj | 8 MiB | the application archive |
| core | 30 MiB | writable data |
| gui | 40 MiB | display resources |
| quickboot | 102 MiB | fast-start data |

At runtime the effective root is a 60 MiB `tmpfs` assembled from the system and application images. Because more than one filesystem can be mounted at `/`, the *last* matching entry in the mount table is the live one: anything inspecting mounts has to read it that way or it will report the wrong filesystem.

---

## 2. How a mod runs without flashing anything

The player has a maintenance path: on boot it looks for a specific encrypted image on a USB volume and, if present, runs a script from inside it. That is the entire mechanism. We write to the stick, never to the player.

The consequence worth internalising: **power off, remove stick, power on, and the player is stock again.** There is nothing to uninstall because nothing was installed. It also means a mistake cannot brick anything, **as long as it does not write to the system persistent partitions**, which this project will focus on not doing. The worst case is a player that fails to start the modified application and falls back, or a crash during a gig.

### The autoexec image

The image is an ISO 9660 filesystem carrying a startup script and the runtime it launches, encrypted sector by sector so the player will accept it.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Cipher | AES-256-CBC |
| Unit | independent 512-byte sectors |
| Initialisation vector | the sector index as a 32-bit little-endian integer, then 12 zero bytes |
| Key input | the first line of a key file you supply |
| Effective key | the first 31 bytes of that line, followed by one zero byte |

That 31-byte quirk is not a design choice, it is a bug preserved for compatibility: the original code copies the key with a bounded string copy that reserves a byte for a terminator. Using the first 32 bytes directly produces a different key and an image the player rejects.

Two practical consequences. Rock Ridge extensions must be enabled or the startup script loses its executable bit. And the image size must stay a multiple of 512 bytes, because the encryption unit is a sector.

The key is yours to supply. It is not in this repository and never will be.

### The hook

Features are implemented as a shared library injected into the application with `LD_PRELOAD`. It is compiled as an ARMv7 shared object, linked `-nostdlib`; libc and pthread symbols resolve against the host process at load time.

One build flag is load-bearing and worth knowing about before it bites you. At `-O2`, Clang rewrites `memcmp(a, b, n) == 0` into a call to `bcmp`, which this player's libc does not export. The hook then fails to load with an undefined symbol, silently, and every run falls back to stock behaviour with nothing in any log to say why. The rewrite happens after the front end, so no warning fires. `-fno-builtin-memcmp -fno-builtin-bcmp` prevents it, and a test pins the resulting symbol set so it cannot come back.

### Modules

Each feature is a directory under a firmware version, described by a `manifest.json`. The desktop application, the command line and the release packager all read the same manifests rather than keeping their own lists.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | stable identifier |
| `firmware` | the exact firmware revision this targets; must match the directory name |
| `runtime_directory` | one directory name written into the image |
| `namespace` | shell prefix for every lifecycle callback, so modules cannot collide |
| `default` | selected unless the user says otherwise |
| `selectable` | `false` for internal services, which cannot be picked directly |
| `order` | load order; dependencies must sort earlier |
| `requires` / `conflicts` | module relationships |
| `files` | source-controlled or generated files to copy into the image, and what must be executable |
| `build_files` | headers this module owns at compile time |
| `arm_hook` | the ARM source and target this module compiles, if any |

A file with `"artifact": true` is read from
`build/artifacts/<firmware>/<module>/` instead of the module source directory.
Generated artifacts stay out of Git; their feature-specific recipes use the
shared builder under `tools/rx3_kernel`.

The build resolves dependencies, rejects cycles and conflicts, and writes the resolved load order into the image. Asking for one feature therefore pulls in the internal core it depends on, without the caller having to know. `make new-module ID=<id>` writes a directory that already satisfies the whole of the above, described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-module).

### The orchestrator

Insertion runs entirely through the manufacturer's own path. Nothing in this project installs a hook into the boot sequence:

```text
player powered on
USB insertion
  the vendor's udev rule fires
  the vendor's decrypt script runs
    decrypts the image with the key and mounts it
    runs the startup script inside, as root
```

From there, one shared orchestrator does the work for every module: discovery, validation, guarded writes, restarting the application, rollback and logging. A module contributes exactly two things: an adapter and its payload. Adding or removing a module requires no change to the orchestrator. That is what the manifest indirection is for.

**Before it modifies anything, it verifies all of the following, and refuses the entire run if any one fails:**

1. the effective root mount really is a RAM filesystem;
2. the application's directory is not a separate mount;
3. the application's checksum is one it explicitly supports;
4. every location it intends to change currently holds either its stock value or the value it would write;
5. the application is stopped before its backing file is touched;
6. every write is read back and compared;
7. the replacement process survives eight seconds, otherwise the original bytes and preload state are restored and the application is started again.

Point 5 is not a nicety. Writing an executable's backing file while its pages are mapped can kill the process with `SIGBUS`, and the failure looks nothing like a patching bug.

Point 7 is what makes the whole approach safe to experiment with: the worst realistic outcome is a few seconds of stock interface, not a device that needs recovering.

Re-inserting a drive into an already-patched session is cheap by design. The orchestrator restarts the application only for a location still holding its stock value, or a module whose runtime part is not already live. Everything else is recognised as done and skipped, so the interface neither freezes nor rescans.

The performance core still writes its diagnostic log to a path chosen for compatibility with existing tooling, reachable only with the diagnostic shell module enabled.

---

## 3. Changing a binary you did not write

Some features cannot be done from a preloaded library and need the application's own machine code changed. The rule for all of them is the same, and it is the most important idea in this codebase:

> Read the location first. If it does not hold exactly the bytes we expect, **stop**. Never write, never guess, never "try anyway".

A binary that does not match is a different binary. It might be a firmware revision we have not studied, or a corrupted copy. Either way the safe response is to refuse, and every patch path (on the device, offline, and under emulation) implements that same guard and reads the value back after writing.

Each patch is stated twice: once for the device and once for the offline tool. A test fails the build if the two ever disagree, because two copies of a constant that drift apart is how you end up writing the right bytes to the wrong place.

### A worked example: longer beat jumps

The jump feature moves playback by a number of beats. Extending its maximum touches five separate things, which is typical. A user-visible number is rarely stored in one place:

| | What changes |
| --- | --- |
| A | the jump distances themselves |
| B | the guard that decides whether a jump is allowed (jumps pads will be off when what's left is shorter in the jump direction) |
| C | the threshold that lights the corresponding indicator |
| D | which images the pads display |
| E | a branch that made repeated presses wait for the beat grid |

The interesting part is A. The new value cannot be encoded as an immediate by the floating-point instruction at that site, so the patch loads the constant through a general register, moves it into the FPU, and converts the negative-path magnitude calculation to single precision. Every jump distance involved is exactly representable in single precision, which is what makes that conversion safe rather than merely convenient.

D is a compromise worth admitting: the shipped display resources contain no image with an arrow for 32 beats jump, so the patch reuses a non-directional image from another page. The jog display is untouched. It is driven by a separate controller with its own glyph set, which has nothing suitable.

---

## 4. The display

### Extending the image table

The application draws from a table of several thousand fixed-size image records. Every draw call resolves an image by index through one lookup function, and that function rejects any index at or past the table's declared count. To show our own artwork we need entries that do not exist.

The obvious approach, hooking the lookup function, was tried and rejected. That function runs continuously from the rendering path, so patching it while the process is live opens a window where the code is half-written. The result crashed shortly after activation. (The fallback worked correctly and restored the stock application, which is the only reason that experiment was cheap.)

What works instead touches nothing hot:

1. Before the application starts, one guarded instruction is rewritten so the declared table size is larger.
2. At startup the hook allocates a second, larger table.
3. Every original record is copied across, with its pixel offsets adjusted so it still points at the original artwork.
4. Our own records occupy the new entries past the end.
5. Only when the whole table is ready is the global pointer swapped, in one atomic write.

The original artwork and indices are never modified. A model of the relocation verifies every copied record as well as the new ones.

**The mistake this replaced is instructive.** An earlier attempt reused a block of indices that looked unused. They were not: they were the colour swatches for the source selector, and the display literally read "Aqua", "Blue", "Default". Because drawing surfaces are decoded and cached, overwriting the pixels late could never be made deterministic. Two apparently unrelated bugs turned out to be one collision: leaks into the source screen, and colour names appearing in performance mode.

### The bitmap font

The player's fonts are flat arrays of fixed-size cells, one per glyph, in codepoint order. No header, no offset table, no metrics.

| | Main Latin font |
| --- | --- |
| Row stride | 7 bytes |
| Cell size | 14 x 27 pixels |
| Bytes per cell | 189 |
| Glyphs | 422, covering Latin, Greek and Cyrillic |
| Index | codepoint - 32, so index 0 is the space character |

Pixels are 4 bits each, two per byte, leftmost pixel in the high nibble. The value is coverage from 0 to 15, plain anti-aliasing with no palette. That is where the sixteen grey levels visible throughout the interface come from.

```python
STRIDE, HEIGHT, WIDTH = 7, 27, 14
CELL = STRIDE * HEIGHT

def coverage(data, codepoint):
    """Return HEIGHT rows of WIDTH coverage values, each 0..15."""
    base = (codepoint - 0x20) * CELL
    rows = []
    for row in range(HEIGHT):
        line = []
        for x in range(WIDTH):
            index = base + row * STRIDE + x // 2
            byte = data[index] if index < len(data) else 0
            line.append(byte >> 4 if x % 2 == 0 else byte & 0x0F)
        rows.append(line)
    return rows
```

The file is 42 bytes shorter than 422 cells would be: the final glyph's trailing blank rows are simply not stored, so a reader must zero-fill the tail. A sibling font uses the same scheme with a different stride, which tells you this is a house format with one fixed size per file rather than a one-off.

**What the file does not contain is advance widths.** Glyphs sit left-aligned in their cell with the remainder blank, so proportional spacing has to come from somewhere else, in this case a metrics function reached through a table populated at runtime. Since that table is filled in dynamically, its contents cannot be recovered by reading the binary; you would have to observe it running. Deriving the advance from the ink extent plus a fixed side bearing is a usable approximation, but visibly tight on pairs like `Y -` and `+1`.

### Matching the typeface

The face is Helvetica Neue LT W1G. That is identified rather than guessed, from two independent artefacts that agree: the desktop library software declares that family in its own interface graphics, and "W1G" is the vendor's World 1 Glyph set (Latin, Greek and Cyrillic), which is exactly the repertoire of the font file. The face is licensed and not redistributable, so our label builder approximates it with a system cut instead of bundling it.

The approximation is fitted, not eyeballed. Fourteen captions in the shipped artwork segment cleanly into individual letters along blank columns, giving ground truth for nineteen capitals. Cap height is a consistent 16 pixels with round letters overshooting to 17, itself confirmation that these are real font renderings rather than hand-drawn artwork. Sweeping weight against size over that ground truth and scoring mean per-pixel error picks Regular at 22 points, clearly ahead of the neighbours.

An earlier fit chose Light at 24. It had been scored on whole-word bounding boxes, which is a weak signal: weight and size trade off against each other and still match a box. Per-glyph pixel error does not have that failure mode.

### Reusing the host's typeface at run time

Nothing in the drawing code sets a font. A control wears whichever face the model it was cloned from was drawn in, which means picking the right model *is* the typography, and there are two of them:

- **A pad label**, captured on its way into the text renderer before a live panel replaces that same draw. The capture takes the first plausible label, then upgrades once to one that also carries a fill, since that is a real button rather than a caption. This is the face the added controls use.
- **A header glyph**, twice the size, kept only as a fallback so that a panel forced open before the row has ever drawn shows something rather than nothing.

The row itself is painted from the pane backdrop, which opens once per pass over the row rather than once per intercepted call. Draws elsewhere in that subtree are the stock furniture the panel stands in for and are dropped; draws *outside* it belong to the vendor and reach the renderer untouched. Keying that test on the deck's window instead of the widget subtree is what used to swallow unrelated labels elsewhere on screen.

### The palette question, still open

Worth writing down because the honest state of it is "we know what, not how".

The stock colours are known, measured off the shipped artwork: a two-pixel frame, a selected fill with black glyphs, an inactive state with grey glyphs. What is *not* known is the encoding the glyph's colour field wants.

The text renderer decodes that field three different ways, choosing by the pixel format of the window it is drawing into, which it reads from the window rather than from the glyph. One branch takes the low byte alone, one the whole word, one unpacks a packed 24-bit value into 5/6/5. Measured against the real layers: one interpretation painted magenta lettering on green, another painted green, and sweeping all 256 low-byte values moved the green channel alone without ever lifting red or blue off zero.

So the code returns zero, which means "leave the cloned model's colour alone". Settling this means identifying the format the window actually reports for those layers and using that branch's encoding. Until then, the pressed state the touch layer already tracks has nothing to paint itself with. An earlier note in the source that every literal colour "looked foreign" is thereby explained rather than repeated.

### Two sizes of one face

One more thing that costs an afternoon if you miss it: **there are two sizes of the same face in play.** The font file is a condensed cut, roughly half the width and slightly taller, used for live text like track titles. The captions beside the effect controls are pre-rendered artwork in the normal width. A label meant to sit in that row must match the artwork, not the font file.

---

## 5. Front-panel input

Every physical control reports a 16-bit code. The complete list was recovered **statically**: one function maps each code to a human-readable name for diagnostics, so decompiling it and resolving the string pointers yields the whole table without pressing a single button.

The decompiler folds some branches into range comparisons rather than equalities, so six codes were re-read from their guard conditions rather than inferred. As an independent check, the extraction reproduced the two pad codes that had already been established much earlier by a completely different route.

This replaced a far worse plan. Mapping the panel by capturing traffic on the internal bus needs one press per control, a person standing at the machine, and a synchronisation window that is easy to miss. Two attempts failed on exactly that. Reading the table is one offline pass with no hardware involved.

Bus capture keeps one use: it alone tells you *which bit of which frame* carries a control. But you do not need that to *inject* input. The handlers take an input object whose layout is known: a 16-bit code, a channel selecting which deck, and a press/release flag. Synthesising one is enough.

The complete code table lives in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-front-panel-codes).

---

## 6. Stems

The largest feature: replacing or removing the vocal from a track in real time, from a sidecar file prepared on a computer.

### Hooking the audio path

Four sites are hooked with guarded trampolines: the function that hands decoded audio to the mixer, the one that associates a file with a deck, the pad handler, and the indicator refresh.

Each site has an eight-byte prologue guard. Three of them can have their stolen instructions copied straight into the trampoline. The fourth begins with a PC-relative load, whose meaning depends on where it sits, so that trampoline loads a copy of the original constant before replaying the instruction after it. This is the standard hazard of prologue-stealing hooks and the reason each site is inspected individually rather than handled by one generic routine.

### Finding the right sidecar

The hook derives a track's base name and looks for a matching sidecar in a fixed directory on the stick.

Two details make this harder than it sounds. The library software truncates a filename to the first 44 characters when it exports a track, leaving the original untouched. So the name on the stick is not the name in the library, and the preparation tool applies the same truncation when it names a sidecar. Trailing spaces survive that cut on both sides and are not trimmed.

Second, two different tracks can truncate to the same name. The load interface gives no reliable way to tell them apart, so the tool **refuses the collision** rather than picking one arbitrarily. Truncation is applied before that comparison, because two names that differ only past character 44 collide on the stick.

Sidecars load asynchronously into anonymous memory. The deck stays on the stock audio path until loading finishes, after which the file on the stick is closed, so pulling the drive after a completed load cannot invalidate a live mapping. Allocation is refused if the payload would exceed 60% of the memory estimated to be available or reclaimable.

### Getting the audio right

This is where the real engineering is, and both problems are silent failures: everything appears to work and the result is subtly wrong.

The instrumental is computed as *full mix minus vocal*. That subtraction is only valid if both come from the same decode. Any difference in phase, delay, gain or sample rate leaves audible residual vocal.

**Delay** is introduced by the container. Compressed formats declare samples the encoder prepended, and decoders normally drop them, so position zero of a normal decode is not position zero of what the player's own decoder emits, padding included. A delay of about a thousand samples puts the stem 25 ms ahead of the mix, which leaves the vocal essentially untouched in the instrumental while the isolated vocal still sounds perfectly fine. You will not hear the bug in the thing you are listening to.

The encoder therefore decodes each source twice, with and without padding removal, locates the trimmed decode inside the untrimmed one to measure the padding exactly, and shifts the stem by that amount. Uncompressed sources declare no padding and are unaffected. When the offset cannot be measured, because a silent decode has no unique pattern to locate, the stem stays on the separator's grid and the run says so rather than guessing.

**Gain** is broken by the separator. Two of the common model architectures scale the mix to a normalisation threshold before inference and emit the stem in that scaled domain. A threshold below 1.0 therefore multiplies the vocal by some factor and leaves the remainder of it in the instrumental, roughly -20 dB of leftover vocal at the tool's own default of 0.9.

Pinning normalisation to 1.0 fixes the common case and is also the highest safe value, since the writer converts to 16-bit integers in a way that wraps rather than clips above full scale. But lossy codecs reconstructing inter-sample peaks, or resampling from a higher rate, can still land above 1.0.

So the encoder measures instead of assuming: the pass that decodes the full track also measures its true peak, and the stem is scaled back accordingly. One trap here. The measurement has to be forced into floating point *ahead of* the integer conversion, because filter chains are negotiated backwards from the output format. A measurement placed after the conversion reads values already clamped to full scale, and cheerfully reports no overshoot at all.

Only stems from architectures that scale the mix are corrected. The others leave it alone. Correction restores the vocal to its true level, so anything that clips is something that genuinely exceeded full scale in the source. The manifest records the correction applied and the number of clipped samples per track.

Levels throughout are peak sample values relative to full scale, not perceptual loudness. No loudness measurement is performed anywhere in this pipeline.

One last case: when the stock reader returns an all-zero region during a seek or a buffer underrun, the hook leaves it alone. Subtracting a vocal from silence would emit an inverted vocal. A 256-frame linear ramp covers each state change.

### Stems file format

To encure perfect phase cancellation when playing only the instrumental, the stems needs to be PCM, that's whay they're heavier than the original audio files.

A 64-byte little-endian header followed by interleaved stereo vocal audio:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| `0x00` | 8 | magic, `RX3STM1\0` |
| `0x08` | 4 | sample rate, always 44100 |
| `0x0c` | 4 | channel count, always 2 |
| `0x10` | 4 | sample format: 1 = float32, 2 = int16 |
| `0x14` | 4 | header size, 64 |
| `0x18` | 8 | frame count |
| `0x20` | 32 | reserved, zero-filled |
| `0x40` | - | interleaved stereo audio |

The default is 16-bit to halve resident memory. The frame count is aligned to the full track as decoded at 44.1 kHz, not to the separator's output duration.

The player's audio path runs at 44,100 frames per second, corroborated by the constructor constants, the buffer sizes and the sample-rate converter it instantiates. Sources at other rates are converted before they reach the hooked buffer.

### Preparing sidecars on the host

Separation itself is not ours. The pipeline drives [audio-separator](https://github.com/nomadkaraoke/python-audio-separator) and FFmpeg as subprocesses, so nothing separation-related is linked into the release archive. Those dependencies together are two orders of magnitude larger than the application.

Components are resolved in a fixed order, first hit wins: the `RX3_SEPARATOR` and `RX3_FFMPEG` overrides, then whatever is on `PATH`, then a managed environment installed under the user's data directory. Supplying your own is therefore equivalent to letting the application install one; a separator found on `PATH` is used as-is, reported as unmanaged, and never rebuilt or removed.

Three pins in that managed environment are deliberate and each has a reason:

- PyTorch comes from the CPU wheel index unless an accelerator is selected, because the default Linux and Windows wheels carry multi-gigabyte CUDA payloads a CPU pipeline never touches.
- `librosa` is held below 1.0, because audio-separator still imports `audioread` and calls `get_duration(filename=...)`, both removed there.
- The seeding interpreter is capped at 3.13, because audio-separator pins `beartype` below 0.19, which rejects the separator's own annotations on 3.14.

FFmpeg found on `PATH` is preferred over the bundled copy, but only once it is shown to carry every filter the pipeline uses. Builds configured without one of them exist, and the failure would otherwise land partway through a long job rather than at startup. An explicit override is exempt: that is the documented escape hatch, so a gap in it is reported rather than acted on.

The data directory keeps the name the earlier standalone application used, so a runtime installed by that version is still found rather than downloaded again. That name is load-bearing and should not be tidied up.

### Which model actually runs

The best models available are roformers, which are PyTorch checkpoints. The ones that reach a GPU without PyTorch are MDX-Net, which are ONNX graphs. Neither runtime is accelerated everywhere, and the split differs per platform:

| Accelerator | PyTorch | ONNX Runtime | Best available | Fastest |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NVIDIA CUDA | GPU | GPU | roformer, 12.6 dB | Demucs, 9.9 dB |
| Apple Silicon | GPU | mostly **CPU** | roformer, 12.6 dB | Demucs, 9.9 dB |
| AMD ROCm | GPU | **CPU** | roformer, 12.6 dB | Demucs, 9.9 dB |
| DirectML | **CPU** | GPU | MDX-Net, 10.2 dB | MDX-Net, 10.2 dB |
| CPU only | CPU | CPU | MDX-Net, 10.2 dB | MDX-Net, 10.2 dB |

On the first three the roformer is both better *and* quicker, so there is nothing to trade. On the last two it is neither: DirectML's PyTorch backend is pinned far behind what a roformer needs, and a CPU-only build has nothing to offload to, where ONNX Runtime is the quicker of the two. Those machines give up 2.4 dB of vocal separation quality to run on the hardware they have.

MDX-Net is also band-limited, with its wall at 17.6 kHz: above that nothing is separated at all, so the air of a vocal stays in the instrumental the deck reconstructs. That is a different kind of loss from a lower score, and it is why the waveform-based Demucs is preferred for the fast path, because it gives up quality without giving up the top of the spectrum.

**Apple Silicon is the case worth explaining, because CoreML looks like it works.** It is offered, it is enabled, and it does take most of the model, but it cannot take the graph whole. On an MDX-Net model it claims 151 of 178 nodes and splits them into 28 partitions, so the run spends its time shuttling tensors back and forth with the CPU. That is why an ONNX model is not the answer there even though a provider is listed. An Intel Mac never reaches Metal at all: the separator gates that path on an ARM processor.

Because the accelerator determines the model, changing the accelerator can change which model a given quality setting resolves to.

A quality setting is therefore not one model. It is one or more *variants*, a list of candidate models plus the tuning each wants, and a setting always names exactly one configuration. Editing anything by hand switches the setting to Custom rather than leaving a preset's name on a configuration it no longer describes. Candidates are a list rather than a filename because the catalogue comes from upstream and can change; the first one actually offered is used, and if none survive, the best-scoring model of that architecture is.

A setting gets a second variant when the trade-off it names cannot be expressed the same way everywhere. Two flags record which inference runtime a given build actually gets GPU work out of, and the preset picks its variant from them.

**Those two flags are answers to measurements, not to capability queries**, and that distinction is the whole point. Neither is derivable from which extras were installed, since Metal and ROCm share those while behaving differently. Neither follows from what the ONNX runtime claims to support, as the Apple Silicon case above demonstrates: it reports CoreML, the separator enables it, and the work still lands on the CPU. If you change one of these flags, say what you measured and on what.

### The overlap parameter, and a click

The knob between the two best quality settings is the separator's `mdxc_overlap`. Despite the name it is a *step* in seconds, not an amount of overlap: the chunk is 11.0 s, the window advances that many seconds each time, so a **lower** value means more passes and more inference.

The default of 8 gives 27% overlap. Stepping to 10 gives 9%, and measurably less work. Stepping to 11 would be free, and wrong. At the chunk length and above, the step is clamped to the chunk and the passes stop overlapping at all, which measured as a discontinuity every 11.0 s reaching 25x the surrounding sample-to-sample difference, against 0.7x away from a boundary.

That is a click. And because the deck reconstructs the instrumental by subtracting the stem, it lands in the instrumental too. The one second of overlap that removes it costs essentially nothing: 0.399 s of compute per second of audio at a step of 10, against 0.406 at 11.

### Estimating time honestly

Speed depends on the model, the device and whatever else the machine is doing, so nothing in the interface quotes a fixed ratio. A first estimate comes from a table of typical rates per architecture and accelerator and is marked as rough. As soon as one track finishes, this machine's measured speed replaces it.

Measured rates are stored per architecture, accelerator **and** quality setting. The last part matters: the top two settings run the same model and differ only in how many passes they make over the audio, so one shared rate would be wrong for each of them in turn.

Nothing here should ever grow a hardcoded duration. The seed rates are keyed on the accelerator alone, precisely so that no measurement taken on one machine becomes a claim about every machine.

### Pads and indicators

Stem controls are active only when the right pad mode is selected, no modifier is held, the deck has a valid sidecar, and the event targets one of two specific pads. Anything else is passed to the stock handler untouched.

The indicator list holds entries for both decks, so filtering by indicator identity alone would disturb the other deck. The hook also checks the channel stored in each entry.

While a sidecar loads, both pads blink, then hold colour once the audio is resident. The blink uses the firmware's own timed state rather than a toggle driven from the hook, so its cadence does not depend on how often the refresh happens to call back. Note that the configured period is a *half*-period: the indicator is lit while the elapsed count is even, so 500 ms means one second on, one second off.

The waveform display is not modified. Its internal three-band representation is not the audio buffer we process.

## 7. Key shift

The player has no key shift, and that absence is real rather than hidden: a reachability census over all 17,745 functions in the binary found no dormant subsystem waiting to be switched on. So this is built rather than unlocked.

### Two engines, picked by direction

The firmware *does* contain a complete granular pitch shifter, the `Pitch` beat effect. It is excellent in one direction and poor in the other. Our own shifter is the mirror image. So each direction gets whichever engine wins it.

Share of output energy still on the intended note, measured on a 440 Hz tone:

| Semitones | -12 | -7 | -5 | +5 | +7 | +12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The firmware's shifter | - | 99.9% | 99.9% | 52.7% | **15.8%** | 84.6% |
| Ours | 43.6% | 69.4% | 99.7% | 99.0% | **97.3%** | 93.8% |

The asymmetry is structural, not a bug in either. Raising pitch has to *repeat* material, 0.414 s of source per second of output at +6 semitones, and that is where grain splices become audible. Lowering pitch skips material instead, which is far more forgiving. Both engines are driven at the exact equal-tempered ratio, and the result lands within ±0.7 cents across the range.

### Where the pitch stage sits, and where it must not

It hooks the deck's playback blocks, 64 to 512 frames at a time, and both of them, because the second replaces the first while Master Tempo is on. Hooking only the first made the shift *vanish* under Master Tempo rather than sound wrong, which is a much harder bug to read.

It deliberately does **not** sit on the buffer read that stems use. That read is random-access, shared with the analysis scan, and measured on hardware only 13.6% of its calls continue where the previous one stopped: two thirds re-read an overlapping position and a fifth move backwards. A shifter carrying a sequential grain cursor cannot live there, and the audible result was a stutter.

Stem mixing is indifferent to that access pattern because it is addressed by absolute frame position, which is exactly why the two features hook different places. This is the clearest example in the codebase of *where* a hook goes being determined by measurement rather than convenience.

### Driving the firmware's engine

Two parameters matter, and one of them cost a long debugging session:

- **Depth**, fixed at the exact unity point of the effect's percentage curve, where its shift speed equals the requested percentage and the mix is fully wet. The constructor leaves it at zero, which is total bypass: the effect runs and never moves a sample. That is why key shift first appeared completely dead.
- **Percentage**, carrying the semitone. The usable range covers exactly -12 to +12. Percentages are integers here, so each semitone takes the closest one; the worst case is -9 semitones, 13 cents flat.

The engine also sizes its working buffers from a frame count set at initialisation, so that field has to cover the largest block the hook can pass, not the audio device's block size.

### Our shifter

Self-contained: no libc, no libm, no allocation. Two read heads walk a history ring at the pitch ratio, half a grain apart, each windowed and cubically interpolated. Every design value in it was measured, and three findings are worth repeating because each one looks like a detail and is not:

- **Splices are aligned by correlation.** Without it, crossfading segments whose phases disagree forces a phase slew, and a phase slew *is* a frequency error. The whole shift came out at 97.9% of what was asked, 36 cents flat at -12.
- **Grain size depends on direction**, 512 frames up against 2048 down. Against an impulse train of eight hits at +7 semitones, a 2048-frame grain returns sixteen, every hit doubled, where 512 returns nine.
- **The crossfade stays amplitude-complementary.** The power-complementary alternative removes about a decibel of pumping on sustained noise and costs four spurious onsets, which is the worse trade.

Two artefacts remain, both inherent to time-domain shifting: roughly 2 dB of level ripple above the input's own on broadband material, and occasional transient doubling when raising pitch. Removing them needs a phase vocoder, and cost is not the obstacle: the current stage measures 4 µs against a 1451 µs block budget, with correlation bursts at 314 µs.

### Measuring both

Off the device, with both harnesses printing the same columns so the two can be read side by side. The first runs the firmware's real ARM code under emulation; the second compiles our shifter for the host. Neither is in this repository. Both are kept with the emulator, which is not published, along with the rest of the scripts that model the player rather than build for it.

```sh
python3 tools/rx3_analysis/emulate_pitch.py <application> --quality
python3 tools/rx3_analysis/measure_shifter.py
```

## 8. Faster decoder polling

Not a patch at all. After startup, a module sends two commands to the application's own debug console on a loopback UDP port, changing the decoder thread's sleep interval from 1 ms to 0.1 ms per deck.

The setting is volatile, alters neither flash nor the executable, and disappears on power off. It costs CPU and guarantees no particular reduction in end-to-end latency. It reduces one specific source of it. Failure is logged and does not stop the runtime.

---

## 9. Building and running

Nothing here is installable through a package manager. There is no packaging metadata and no console script; every entry point is invoked as a path.

### Make targets

| Target | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `make help` | print the target list (the default) |
| `make hook` | cross-compile the ARM hook and assert the resulting binary |
| `make payload-hook` | compile the hook variant a payload ships |
| `make autoexec KEY=<path>` | build the runtime image; `KEY` is required and must exist |
| `make payload` | assemble the mods into a runnable payload |
| `make app` | run the desktop application from source |
| `make test` | run the regression guards, then the unit tests |
| `make preflight` | inspect every publishable file |
| `make clean` | remove the build directory and nothing else |

`PYTHON` defaults to `python3`, `BUILD_DIR` to `build`, `FIRMWARE` to `1.19`, `CC` to `clang` unless the environment sets it. `MODULES` empty means "the manifest defaults".

### The desktop application

One Tkinter window with a tab for each half of preparing a drive. It replaces two earlier separate applications that shipped as two downloads for one workflow.

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `main.py` | the window, the two tabs, and the `--self-test` entry point CI smoke-tests |
| `mod_generator.py` | the **USB Runtime** tab: picks modules and writes the image |
| `stem_studio.py` | the **Vocal Stems** tab, plus the Advanced options dialog |
| `theme.py` | appearance detection, the shared styles, the path-row widget |

**Neither tab holds engine logic.** They drive `tools/rx3_runtime/` and `tools/rx3_stems/` respectively, which is why the command line and the packager can produce identical results without duplicating anything.

One rule in `theme.py` is easy to break, and the result is invisible to whoever broke it. Light or dark is decided from the colour Tk is actually painting, not from an operating-system query, and **nothing may hard-code a foreground colour.** A fixed grey is unreadable in whichever appearance it was not chosen for. Only classic Tk widgets, which the theme engine does not reach, are recoloured by hand, and the log pane is the single case.

```sh
make app                          # or: python3 apps/rx3-toolbox/main.py
```

### Command-line tools

Build a runtime with specific modules:

```sh
python3 tools/rx3_runtime/cli.py build --firmware 1.19 \
  --patch beatjump-32bars --patch stems \
  --key /path/to/keyfile --output build
```

`--patch` repeats; omitting it selects every module whose manifest sets `default`. `--prebuilt-hook` accepts an already-compiled hook instead of invoking the compiler.

Build and inspect a runtime image:

```sh
python3 tools/rx3_firmware/firmware_image.py autoexec \
  build/runtime build/autoexec.bin --key /path/to/keyfile
python3 tools/rx3_firmware/firmware_image.py verify-autoexec \
  build/autoexec.bin --key /path/to/keyfile
```

Encode a sidecar:

```sh
python3 tools/rx3_stems/make_sidecar.py vocals.wav "Artist - Title.rx3stem" \
  --match-full "Artist - Title.mp3" --separator-normalization 1.0
```

Patch a host copy of the application offline. Apply in this order when both are needed; each refuses unexpected content, and applying then reverting in reverse order restores the input byte for byte:

```sh
python3 -m tools.rx3_patcher.beatjump_32bars rbp -o rbp.32bars
python3 -m tools.rx3_patcher.beatjump_no_quantize rbp.32bars -o rbp.patched
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Read by | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RX3_SEPARATOR` | Stem Studio | path to a separator binary, instead of searching |
| `RX3_FFMPEG` | Stem Studio | path to FFmpeg; used as given, a missing filter is reported rather than worked around |
| `RX3_STEM_STUDIO_HOME` | Stem Studio | overrides the managed runtime and model cache location |
| `RX3_PREBUILT_HOOK` | packaging | path to the compiled hook; required when packaging, with no fallback |
| `RX3_STEMS_DIR` | on-device stems module | overrides the sidecar directory |
| `DECODER_SLEEP_NS` | on-device decoder module | overrides the polling interval |
| `CC` | build | compiler for the ARM hook |

### Prerequisites

| Component | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 3.12 in CI | no floor is declared or enforced |
| `cryptography`, `pycdlib` | pinned | `pycdlib` is imported lazily, with an external fallback |
| Clang and LLD | any recent | needed to compile the hook |
| FFmpeg | any complete build | must carry the `aformat`, `apad`, `aresample`, `astats`, `atrim` and `volume` filters |

Stem separation additionally needs a host Python between 3.10 and 3.13 to seed its own environment; that range is enforced in code. The separator and FFmpeg run as subprocesses, so no separation dependency is linked into the release archive. Which accelerator an environment was built for is recorded beside it, because a CPU-only build cannot be accelerated after the fact.

Cross-compilation flags:

```text
--target=arm-linux-gnueabi -march=armv7-a -marm -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon
-fPIC -fno-stack-protector -fno-builtin-memcmp -fno-builtin-bcmp
-O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror
-fuse-ld=lld -shared -nostdlib -Wl,--hash-style=sysv -Wl,--build-id=none
```

### Supported binaries

Four application checksums are accepted, all corresponding to firmware 1.19, which has no sub-revisions. An unlisted checksum aborts before anything is modified. This is the same refuse-rather-than-guess rule as every patch site.

### On the root password

The runtime does not need one. During filesystem analysis, on 10 August 2026, the stock password hash was found to use a legacy algorithm with no adaptive work factor that considers only the first eight characters, and it fell in about three minutes. Neither the hash nor the plaintext is published. Only the optional remote-shell module, disabled by default, uses the stock account at all.

The finding has not been reported to the manufacturer, and no report is planned. It is recorded here so that the state of it is not left to inference: what is written above is the whole of what this project has done with it.

## Appendix A: front-panel codes

Recovered statically as described in [section 5](#5-front-panel-input). Codes are 16-bit values carried in the input object; the channel selects the deck.

### Pad mode selectors

| Code | Control |
| --- | --- |
| `0x4113` | Hot Cue |
| `0x4114` | Beat Loop |
| `0x4115` | Slip Loop |
| `0x4116` | Beat Jump |

### Performance pads

Pads 1 to 8 occupy consecutive codes from `0x4117` to `0x411e`. The last two are the ones the stems feature claims.

### Browse controls

These travel a different path from the pads: a table pumped by the interface cycle rather than the deck's own handlers, which is why they respond even when the deck is not started.

| Index | Control |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | Source |
| 5 | Browse |
| 6 | Tag List |
| 7 | Playlist |
| 8 | Search |
| 10 | Menu / Utility (a long press, held up to three seconds) |
| 11 | Rotary encoder push |
| 12, 13 | Load, deck 1 and deck 2 |
| 17 | Back |

Menu is worth calling out: the handler measures how long the key is held, so tapping it is a *different gesture*, not a faster one.
